      <h1>Laker Young Talent</h1>
      <h2>Lonzo Ball</h2>
      <p>Lonzo Ball is an extremely exciting young player who's playmaking skills are unheard of. His ability to attack and score while also knowing exactly where his teammates are on the floor is impressive and his ability to shoot has improved with his time in the NBA. Coming into the league as a rookie, his expectations may have been the highest since LeBron was drafted in 2003, and he did his best to live up to it. Unfortunately, Lonzo got injured last season and the injury was felt around the Laker nation. Some think the Lakers could have made the playoffs if he stayed healthy, but theres always a new year. This year should be a pretty exciting year for Lonzo as LeBron James has just joined him in the ongoing war for the Kings of the West.</p>
      <h2>Brandon Ingram</h2>
      <p>The second third year forward has grown remarkably over the seasons. His first season, he had the strong mentorship of Kobe Bryant but sadly that was his last season with that help(Kobe retired). Brandon Ingram is has the ability to get to the basket with ease and shoot at an advanced level for someone with his playstyle. Last season, Ingram had to do a lot of heavy lifting when Lonzo went down and there was not much help around him. This season however, that should change jarasticly. With the addition of LeBron James, there is no doubt that the young Lakers team will have almost infinite help. Brandon Ingram is a scary player and will have a big impact of the success off the Lakers this season.</p>
  
      <h2>Kyle Kuzma</h2>
      <p>Kyle Kuzma was a went 26th overall in the 2017 draft to the Los Angeles Lakers. His value was almost looked over because the Lakers had already made their splash pick by drafting Lonzo Ball. Kuzma was just a power forward to fill the roster spot. However when the NBA season came, Kuzma was amazing. He proved his shot and punished opponents who didn't contest, he proved that he was able to guard opponents that may be bigger that him, and he proved that he can finish inside with power. This exciting young player is crazy and will definitely play a huge role in the Laker rotation this season.</p>

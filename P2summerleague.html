      <h1>Summer League Summary</h1>
      <h2>2017 Summer League Season</h2>
      <h4>The official Summer League Season has come to an end and now it's time to talk about it!</h4>
      <h3>The Point Guard Star</h3>
      <p>Josh Hart has torn up the summer league this season with over 20 points per game. His athleticism for a point guard is rare along with his ability to score both inside and outside which helped make him not only a dominant player in summer league, but a dominant player that deserved and recieved the MVP award. Josh Hart emerged to the scene last season as a rescue for the Lakers after Lonzo Ball was injured. Josh Hart was on fire pretty much all throughout the summer league season and showed all signs of improvement as he is in the makings for a breakout second season this year.</p>
      <h3>The Duel Domination Piece</h3>
      <p>Svi Mykhailiuk provided an excellent help to the Lakers summer league team. The rookie out of Kansas shot over 40% from three-point range and was a dynamic part of the summer league offense. Combined, Hart and Mykhailiuk provided an unstoppable force which ploud through almost every team in the summer league and proppelled them to the championship game where they unfortunately lost. Although the loss in the championship weas hard, the Lakers young talent did not hang their heads as they know they are primed for a huge upcoming season.</p>

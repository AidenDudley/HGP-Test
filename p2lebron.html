      <h1>LeBron's oustanding career</h1>
      <h2>14-time all-star</h2>
      <h3>Unprivelaged child</h3>
      <p>For starters, most would say LeBron James had among the worst childhoods possible. LeBron was born in Akron, Ohio on December 30, 1984 to 16 year old Gloria James. Gloria was in high school when LeBron was born. His father was a 44 year-old ex-prisoner and ran off on the two because he was uninterested in having a family. To this day, LeBron goes by his mothers last name "James." </p>
      <h3>Highschool Hopes</h3>
      <p>LeBron was an excellent athlete from the start. He was recruited to the high school of St. Vincent-St. Mary's. There he developed a name for himself as an extaordinary basketball and football player. In addition to basketball, LeBron played on the St. Vincent-St. Mary's varsity football team. As a matter of fact, LeBron was so good at football, D1 colleges offered him full ride football scholarships. By the end of LeBron's highschool, he had over 10 awards for basketball, and over 5 awards for football. Basically, LeBron was in the drivers seat and didn't have to bend to anyone as to what he wants to do with his life. In the 2003 NBA Draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers had the first overall pick and offered LeBron a $19 million contract to skip college and go straight to the NBA. LeBron couldn't deny the offer so he decided to skip college and go straight to the NBA. </p>

In his rookie season he would go on to become the third player to average at least 20 points, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds in their rookie season.
